# Olist-Brazil-MongoDB-NoSQL-Project

This project is the continous project of Olist Brazil MySQL Project; https://github.com/Nasutan/Olist-Brazil-MySQL-SQL-Project which involves the use of both SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases to manage and analyze data. The project demonstrates the advantages and disadvantages of both types of databases. While NoSQL databases like MongoDB are flexible and scalable, they may lack the query flexibility and performance of SQL databases. In this case, SQL databases are chosen because they excel at handling structured data and complex queries while maintaining data integrity. This project highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate database type based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data and analysis needed. It also emphasizes the significance of maintaining data integrity and query flexibility in data analysis projects.
